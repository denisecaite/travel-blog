                <p>How to get to Cebu By Sea<br>Cebu is home to 80% of the shipping companies in the Philippines. It serves as a connectivity hub for ships sailing to Luzon and Mindanao. Moreover, Cebu serves as the central nervous system for the maritime activity in the Visayas. It connects to several islands in the region including some ports in Mindanao and Luzon. Its international port caters to cargo ships and cruise liners that also serves as an alternative gateway to the region.</p>
                <p>How to get to Cebu By Land<br>Taking the bus is the best option when travelling from one end of Cebu to another. This can be done by taking a ride from the north or south terminal. Jeepneys provide the mode of transportation when going for a city trip. This gives tourists the chance to meet local people. Likewise, there is the tartanilla, which are horse-drawn carts, that give tourists the chance to experience the lives of early Cebuanos. Because of their availability around the city, taxis have been the most preferred mode of traveling in and around Cebu. Aside from accessibility, taxis are also cheap and efficient. The majority of the drivers know their way around the city. One can easily flag down another taxi in case the first driver is not familiar with the city.</p>
                <p>Most of the taxis in the island are metered. The fare starts at 40 pesos and an additional 13.50 would be charged for every 2 kilometers. One must be cautious of drivers who refuse to use their meters or collect fare that exceeds the amount indicated on the meter.Whenever you encounter taxi drivers who refuse to use the meter or deliberately go to the wrong direction, the best thing to do is to embark from the taxi and flag down another cab. Dont forget to take the taxi driver's name or the taxi's plate number and report it to the Land Transport Office (LTO).
                    Whenever possible, do not take private taxis. These drivers usually have the tendency of taking advantage of tourists by charging them five to ten times more than the regular rate. Taking private taxis is advisable only when you are going on a long trip and you would want to negotiate for a fixed cost.
                    As you can see, whatever mode of transportation you choose, there is an assurance that you will be reaching your destination.</p>
